# MODULE 3 | Individual project: Rick & Morty

## Summary
I have been asked to create a website where the users can see the characters of the TV show named Rick & Morty.

## How it works

When the user open the website, he found a list of de characters of the TV show. At the top of the page, there is a form witch is used to search by name or race.
-Pressing on the characters will appear a personal card with the information of that character and a button to go back.
